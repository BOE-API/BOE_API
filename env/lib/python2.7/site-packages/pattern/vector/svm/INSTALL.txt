The pattern.vector module comes bundled with precompiled binaries for LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR. These should work on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, Mac OS X and Ubuntu architectures. If not, you need to compile a binary from source.

To install from source, download the latest versions of LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR:
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/

- From the command line, do "make" in libsvm/. 
- Now do "make" in libsvm/python/. 
- You should see a file "libsvm.so.2", which is the binary you need.
- Put it in pattern/vector/svm/libsvm-x.xx/

Repeat the steps for LIBLINEAR.

You may need to rename option "-soname" to "-install_name" in the Makefile on Mac OS X. 

You may need to modify pattern/vector/svm/svm.py around line 15 to import the new binary. Please send us a copy of the compiled binary so we can include it in the next release.
